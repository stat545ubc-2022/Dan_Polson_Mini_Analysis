This mini-analysis takes a dataset of trees from vancouver and cleans and analyzes the data. Milestone 1 was building ideas for an analysis, and 
milestone 2 is the analysis itself. The .md files contain the markdown version of each milestone, and the .rmd files contain the r-markdown scripts
that they use. Our finaly analysis creates a linear model analyzing how tree diameter varied with time and region.
